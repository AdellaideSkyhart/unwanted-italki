# Hide unwanted games, channels and communities on: twitch.tv

## Features
- hide unwanted games
- hide unwanted channels
- hide unwanted communities
- hide unwanted creative communities
- blacklist is automatically synced between devices (requires Google account to be linked with Chrome)
- supports one-click-toggle to disable/enable extension

## Known Issues
- blacklisting (many) popular items might result in blank/fragmentary initial views\
  workaround: scroll down to load more items
- changing to a language specific directory may result in an empty view\
  workaround: reload the page (hard reload) to restore the view
- flashing views are a result of how DOM manipulation is detected (interval based)\
  workaround: none so far, Twitch running on React/Redux makes this difficult to fix

## Notice
Twitch is infamous for changing their website without further notice, which may break this extension over night. If you notice pages no longer working properly, disable the extension and wait for an update.
