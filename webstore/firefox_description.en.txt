<b>Support the continuous development of this extension</b>
I am working on this extension in my spare time. And although I don't watch twitch.tv that much anymore, I still want people to be able to hide content they are not interested in. So as long as Twitch doesn't offer a native way to achieve that, I will continue developing this extension and make it work with future updates to the twitch.tv website. If you want to support me, feel free to spread the word and/or <a href="https://www.paypal.me/devservice/5eur">consider donating</a>. ❤️

<b>Contributing to this extension</b>

<b>Notice</b>
Twitch is infamous for changing their website without further notice, which may break this extension over night. If you notice pages no longer working properly, disable the extension, report the issue and wait for an update.
